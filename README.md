<h2> JavaScript Business Card Maker</h2>

This app focuses on simplicity but is the start of larger idea, that of an app that will allow users to build themselves business cards. At the moment however only a rough sketch exists. 

To see a demo:

This app works best in full screen.

This basic app is build using basic Javascrpt with no libraries, along with Bootstrap. The idea was to create a basic layout using simple tools As of now, one can fill in the sections of the app and create a very basic business card but can proceed no further. There is no server or database in which to save the card or perform further operations. 

Using this basic idea I intend to build out a more complex and useful business card app using React wth an Express server.
